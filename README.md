Face detection -- also called facial detection -- is an artificial intelligence (AI) based computer technology used to find and identify human faces in digital images. Face detection technology can be applied to various fields -- including security, biometrics, law enforcement, entertainment and personal safety -- to provide surveillance and tracking of people in real time.

Face detection has progressed from rudimentary computer vision techniques to advances in machine learning (ML) to increasingly sophisticated artificial neural networks (ANN) and related technologies; the result has been continuous performance improvements. It now plays an important role as the first step in many key applications -- including face tracking, face analysis and facial recognition. Face detection has a significant effect on how sequential operations will perform in the application.


How face detection works

Face detection applications use algorithms and ML to find human faces within larger images, which often incorporate other non-face objects such as landscapes, buildings and other human body parts like feet or hands. Face detection algorithms typically start by searching for human eyes -- one of the easiest features to detect. The algorithm might then attempt to detect eyebrows, the mouth, nose, nostrils and the iris. Once the algorithm concludes that it has found a facial region, it applies additional tests to confirm that it has, in fact, detected a face.

To help ensure accuracy, the algorithms need to be trained on large data sets incorporating hundreds of thousands of positive and negative images. The training improves the algorithms' ability to determine whether there are faces in an image and where they are.
